### 📚 Layer Responsibilities

| Layer           | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| **Domain**       | Core business logic, independent of any framework or tech |
| **Application**  | Orchestrates use cases, triggers domain logic |
| **Infrastructure** | Implements ports, persistence, messaging |
| **Interfaces**   | Controllers, resolvers, CLI – how external actors talk to the app |
| **Shared**       | Pure utilities and cross-context tooling |

---

### 💡 Command Handler Example (Application Layer)

```ts
export class CreateOrderCommand {
  constructor(
    public readonly customerId: string,
    public readonly items: OrderItemDto[],
  ) {}
}
```

```ts
@CommandHandler(CreateOrderCommand)
export class CreateOrderHandler {
  constructor(
    private readonly orderRepo: OrderRepository,
    private readonly eventBus: EventBus,
  ) {}

  async execute(command: CreateOrderCommand) {
    const order = Order.create(command.customerId, command.items);
    await this.orderRepo.save(order);
    this.eventBus.publish(new OrderCreatedEvent(order.id));
  }
}
```

- **Highly testable** – domain logic has no NestJS dependencies
- **Clean separation of concerns**
- **Supports CQRS, Event Sourcing, and modularity**
- **Easy to evolve** without breaking the architecture

## 🔍 **Core Principles of DDD, Hexagonal, and Clean Architecture**

---

### 🧱 **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**

| Principle                         | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Ubiquitous Language**          | Use one common language between devs and domain experts across code, docs, and conversations. |
| **Bounded Contexts**             | Divide large systems into separate, loosely-coupled models with clear boundaries and meaning. |
| **Entities & Value Objects**     | Distinguish between things with identity (entities) and descriptive concepts (value objects). |
| **Aggregates & Invariants**      | Group related domain objects under an aggregate root that enforces rules and consistency. |
| **Domain Events**                | Model “something happened” in the business — enables async flows, audit logs, and event sourcing. |
| **Repositories**                 | Abstract persistence so the domain is not coupled to databases or queries. |
| **Strategic Design**             | Align code and teams with the business using context maps, core domains, and subdomains. |

🧠 **DDD is about** modeling **complex business logic** clearly and **with the people who understand it** (domain experts).

---

### 🧲 **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**

| Principle                         | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Dependency Inversion**         | The application core depends only on **abstractions**, not implementations. |
| **Ports**                        | Interfaces defined by the app for driving (inbound) and driven (outbound) operations. |
| **Adapters**                     | Implementations of the ports, such as HTTP controllers, DBs, message brokers, etc. |
| **Testability First**            | Core logic is fully testable without any external systems. |
| **Technology Agnostic Core**     | The domain/application layer doesn’t know about Express, Prisma, Kafka, etc. |
| **Symmetric I/O**                | Inputs and outputs are treated the same way (everything via ports). |

🧠 **Hexagonal is about** keeping your **business logic isolated** from technical frameworks and infrastructure.

---

### 🧼 **Clean Architecture (Uncle Bob)**

| Principle                         | Description |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Separation of Concerns**       | Each layer has a clear role: entities, use cases, interface adapters, frameworks. |
| **Strict Dependency Direction**  | Code **can only depend inward** — outer layers depend on inner, never vice versa. |
| **Enterprise Use Cases**         | Use cases live in the core and orchestrate application flow. |
| **Entities Are Pure**            | Domain entities contain only business logic — no HTTP, DB, or UI concerns. |
| **Interface Adapters**           | Controllers, gateways, presenters — glue between use cases and infrastructure. |
| **Frameworks as Tools**          | Frameworks are "plug-ins", not the core of your application. |

🧠 **Clean Architecture is about** building **independent, layered, maintainable systems**, where **use cases drive everything**.

### 🧠 **Domain-Driven Design (DDD) — 25 Interview Questions & Answers**

<details><summary><b>1. What is Domain-Driven Design (DDD)?</b></summary>

**DDD** is a software design approach that focuses on building software based on the **core business domain** and its **rules**, in close collaboration with domain experts.

It emphasizes:
- Modeling real-world concepts
- Using **Ubiquitous Language**
- Organizing code around **domain logic**, not technical layers

</details>

<details><summary><b>2. What are the building blocks of DDD?</b></summary>

Core building blocks:
- **Entity**
- **Value Object**
- **Aggregate**
- **Aggregate Root**
- **Domain Event**
- **Repository**
- **Service**

Plus tactical patterns like Bounded Contexts, Ubiquitous Language, etc.

</details>

<details><summary><b>3. What is an Entity?</b></summary>

An **Entity** is an object with a **unique identity** that persists over time.

```ts
class User {
  constructor(public readonly id: string, public name: string) {}
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><b>4. What is a Value Object?</b></summary>

A **Value Object** has no identity; it’s defined only by its attributes.

- Immutable
- Comparable by value

Example:
```ts
class Email {
  constructor(private readonly value: string) {}
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><b>5. What is an Aggregate?</b></summary>

An **Aggregate** is a cluster of domain objects (entities + value objects) treated as a single unit for data changes. It enforces **invariants**.

Only the **Aggregate Root** is allowed to be modified directly.

</details>

<details><summary><b>6. What is an Aggregate Root?</b></summary>

The main **entry point** of an Aggregate.

- Guarantees consistency boundaries.
- Exposes methods for modifying aggregate state.

```ts
class Order { // Aggregate Root
  addItem(product: Product) {}
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><b>7. What is a Domain Event?</b></summary>

An event that represents something that **happened in the domain**.

- Immutable
- Carries context
- Used for integration, side-effects, event sourcing

```ts
class UserRegisteredEvent {
  constructor(public readonly userId: string) {}
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><b>8. What is a Repository?</b></summary>

A **Repository** abstracts access to **Aggregates**.

- Hides data access logic
- Returns domain objects, not raw data

```ts
interface OrderRepository {
  save(order: Order): Promise<void>;
  findById(id: string): Promise<Order>;
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><b>9. What is a Domain Service?</b></summary>

Use a **Domain Service** when logic:
- Doesn’t naturally belong to an Entity or Value Object
- Involves multiple aggregates

```ts
class PaymentService {
  charge(user: User, amount: Money) {}
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><b>10. What is a Bounded Context?</b></summary>

A **Bounded Context** defines a **logical boundary** for a domain model, where terms and behaviors have consistent meaning.

Each microservice usually maps to one bounded context.

</details>

<details><summary><b>11. What is Ubiquitous Language?</b></summary>

A **shared language** between devs and domain experts, used in:
- Class names
- Events
- Commands

It reduces misunderstandings and improves model alignment with the real world.

</details>

<details><summary><b>12. What is the difference between an Entity and a Value Object?</b></summary>

| Feature    | Entity             | Value Object        |
|------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| Identity   | Yes (ID)           | No                  |
| Mutability | Usually mutable    | Usually immutable   |
| Equality   | By ID              | By value            |

</details>

<details><summary><b>13. Can an Aggregate contain other Aggregates?</b></summary>

No. Aggregates **must not cross boundaries**. One Aggregate may reference another by ID, but must not enforce its invariants or lifecycle.

</details>

<details><summary><b>14. How is DDD related to CQRS?</b></summary>

DDD and CQRS are often used together:
- **Command side** = Aggregates, Domain Logic, Events
- **Query side** = Read-optimized view models

They help **scale** and **separate complexity** in large systems.

</details>

<details><summary><b>15. How is DDD related to Event Sourcing?</b></summary>

In Event Sourcing:
- Aggregate state is derived by **replaying events**
- Events are the **source of truth**
- DDD helps model meaningful domain events

DDD and ES align well, but can be used separately.

</details>

<details><summary><b>16. What is the role of Application Services in DDD?</b></summary>

They coordinate use cases, handle:
- Commands
- Transactions
- Aggregates
- Domain services

They should NOT contain domain logic.

```ts
class PlaceOrderService {
  execute(command: PlaceOrderCommand) { ... }
}
```

</details>

<details><summary><b>17. Should Entities expose setters?</b></summary>

No. Instead, use **intention-revealing methods** like:
```ts
order.markAsShipped();
```

This preserves invariants and keeps state transitions meaningful.

</details>

<details><summary><b>18. What is Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL)?</b></summary>

An **ACL** is a translator between two Bounded Contexts or external systems.

It protects your domain model from external chaos by:
- Translating APIs, schemas
- Decoupling systems

</details>

<details><summary><b>19. What is a Specification in DDD?</b></summary>

A **Specification** encapsulates business rules and logic for querying.

Used in Repositories, validation, etc.

```ts
const activeUsers = new ActiveUsersSpec();
repo.findBySpec(activeUsers);
```

</details>

<details><summary><b>20. Can DDD be used in monoliths?</b></summary>

Yes. DDD is about **modeling**, not architecture. You can:
- Use Modules for Bounded Contexts
- Apply Aggregates and Entities
- Split command/query responsibilities

</details>

<details><summary><b>21. Should Repositories return Entities or DTOs?</b></summary>

Repositories should return **domain objects (Entities/Aggregates)**.

Mapping to DTOs is done:
- At query layer
- In application services
- In read-models (if using CQRS)

</details>

<details><summary><b>22. What’s the difference between Domain Event and Integration Event?</b></summary>

- **Domain Event**: Internal, meaningful to business logic
- **Integration Event**: External communication between bounded contexts or services

They may look similar but serve different purposes.

</details>

<details><summary><b>23. How does DDD help with microservices?</b></summary>

- Encourages clear **Bounded Contexts**
- Supports **data ownership** per service
- Promotes **strong models** and autonomy
- Enables **event-driven communication**

</details>

<details><summary><b>24. When should you avoid DDD?</b></summary>

Avoid if:
- Domain is **simple CRUD**
- Team lacks access to domain experts
- Project is small and won’t evolve much

DDD adds complexity — use it **when complexity already exists**.

</details>

<details><summary><b>25. How to apply DDD in NestJS?</b></summary>

- **Entities / Value Objects** → `domain/`
- **Aggregates** → services that enforce invariants
- **Repositories** → interfaces in `domain/`, implementations in `infrastructure/`
- **Application Services** → orchestration in `application/`
- **Modules** → represent bounded contexts

Use DI + interfaces to enforce separation between layers.

</details>
